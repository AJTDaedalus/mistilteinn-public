# DESIGN — the wish planner

**Status:** design, 2026-09-22. Implements `docs/RESEARCH_wish_planner.md`, which carries the
Fribbels review, the verified prototype and the income-source work. Read it first; nothing
here repeats its evidence.

## Branch policy

**`feat/wish-planner`, off `dev`. No direct commits to `dev`.** One branch, no parallel
tracks — the math, the income store and the page are one feature and the page is untestable
without the other two. Task 0 of `docs/TASKS_wish_planner.md` is the branch-setup gate.

The research doc's two commits are already on this branch; it was renamed from
`docs/wish-planner-feasibility` rather than merged, so the feature's evidence travels with it.

---

## 1. What it answers

Given primogems, Intertwined Fate, current pity, whether the next 5★ is guaranteed, and how
many 50/50s have been lost since the last win — **what is the chance of reaching C0, C1 … C6,
R1 … R5, and what does each cost on average?**

Deliberately the same shape as Fribbels' Warp Planner (owner: *"the goal would be to be very
similar so people are familiar"*), with one addition it has no equivalent of: **Capturing
Radiance**, exposed as a previous-losses input.

## 2. Non-goals

- **Not an optimizer.** It reports odds; it does not recommend who to pull.
- **No day-level proration.** Owner, 2026-09-22: *"other than welkin, income isn't predictable
  day to day, some things are time gated and many things are when the user does them."* Income
  is added in **whole patches**, ticked on or off. §5.
- **No starglitter, no acquaint fate.** Owner, 2026-09-22: *"just primogems + intertwined."*
- **No standard banner, no chronicled wish.** The question is the limited banners.

## 3. The math

`app/services/wishes/` — a pure function, no session, no ORM.

Fribbels' algorithm (`RESEARCH_wish_planner.md` §2), generalised to Capturing Radiance:

1. **First-passage PMF** — `pulls_to_next_five_star`, built from the banner's four pity
   parameters. Index *k* is *exactly k pulls*; index 0 is 0.0.
2. **Pity conditioning** — slice from the current pity, renormalise.
3. **Per-copy cost** — win at `w`, else convolve with a fresh cycle and take the guarantee.
4. **Convolve down the ladder**, read the CDF at the budget.

**Capturing Radiance** makes `w` depend on a counter that survives a copy, so the carried state
is a **4-vector of PMFs indexed by the counter (0–3)** rather than one PMF. Each milestone
mixes: win → counter 0; lose → counter+1, guaranteed. Exact, and ~14 ms with `numpy.convolve`.

**The off-by-one is the thing to protect.** A PMF whose index 0 means "one pull" makes `Σ k·p`
low by exactly one **per 5★ drawn** — 1.6 on one copy, 10.5 across seven. Invisible on a single
milestone, linear down the ladder. `tests/unit/test_wish_planner_math.py` pins the ladder, not
just the first row.

### Validation

`tests/unit/test_wish_planner_crossval.py` pins the exact output against numbers **measured
against gachasim's Monte Carlo** during the research pass (300k runs/cell, all |z| < 2):

| banner | copies | expected mean |
|---|---|---|
| character | 1 | 93.45 |
| character | 2 | 186.11 |
| character | 7 | 634.85 |
| weapon | 1 | 86.53 |
| weapon | 7 | 605.72 |

These are a **regression pin, not an oracle** — the oracle was gachasim, and re-deriving them
means re-running it. The test says so.

### Rates

`app/data/wishes/banner_rates.json`, hand-maintained, **every entry cites a source** — the same
rule and the same enforcement as `app/data/planner/curated_rates.json`. Values come from
gachasim's `configurations.py` and its `docs/RESEARCH_gacha_math_audit.md`, which carries the
source links. Carried forward with them:

- **`soft_pity_start` and `increase_rate` are jointly fitted** to the published consolidated
  rate and not separately identified. The centre is stable (< 0.02 pulls); the far tail is not
  (18–26). So the planner reports means and mid-range probabilities and **must not grow a
  "worst case" column** off the fitted curve. `published_worst_case` — 180 and 160 — is the
  figure for that.
- **Capturing Radiance is a community model**, `(0.50, 0.525, 0.75, 1.0)`, whose stationary win
  rate of 55.65 % reproduces HoYoverse's published 55 %.

## 4. State validation

Two rules the UI and the service both enforce, from `RESEARCH_wish_planner.md` §5:

1. **`guaranteed=true` with `losses=0` is unreachable** — arming the guarantee requires a lost
   50/50, and that same loss increments the counter. The service rejects it; the page cannot
   express it.
2. **At `losses=3` the counter is already a guarantee** (`w(3) = 1.0`). "Not guaranteed, 3
   losses" and every guaranteed row share a mean, and the page says why rather than letting it
   read as a bug.

Capturing Radiance applies to the **character banner only**. The weapon banner's Epitomized
Path is an ordinary two-branch guarantee at `0.375`.

## 5. Income

`RESEARCH_wish_planner.md` §10 has the sourcing, the three invariants and the hoyincome
finding. Design consequences only:

- **`wish_income`** — one row per (version, tier), tier in `f2p | welkin | welkin_bp`. Plus
  `is_estimate` and `fetched_at`.
- **`scripts/refresh_wish_income.py`** fetches and upserts. **Never called from `app/`.**
- **`app/data/wishes/income_snapshot.json`** is committed, and is what a fresh clone and CI
  read. The doctrine is `app/data/yuanshen/snapshot/`'s: the app never depends on a live fetch.
- **Three invariants gate a refresh**, and a failure refuses the whole update rather than
  writing part of it: derived `f2p + welkin + bp` equals the sheet's `Total P2P`; per-patch
  `Total F2P` equals the `summary` tab; both subscriptions are flat across patches.
- **Refuse an implausible shrink**, `seed_db`'s `PRUNE REFUSED` rule.
- **`fetched_at` ships in the payload.** Stale projected income is the
  "how many Teachings do I hold" failure — it goes wrong invisibly.
- **`is_estimate` survives to the page.** The sheet publishes `7.1 est.`; a forecast shown as
  history is the same error as a mean shown as a certainty.

**Whole patches, ticked.** The sheet has no phase structure — I checked every per-patch tab and
column A carries only `Events / Other New Content / Web, Mail, Apologems / Repeating Content`.
Fribbels splits by half-patch; we cannot without inventing a split, and the owner's ruling says
the lumpiness is real rather than smoothable. So the control is a multi-select of **whole
patches at or after the current one**, at one of the three tiers. **This is a deliberate
divergence from Fribbels and the only one in the UI.**

## 6. Surface

- `POST /api/v1/wishes/plan` — the whole request in, the ladder out. No persistence, no
  caching: it is cheaper than the cache lookup would be.
- `GET /api/v1/wishes/income` — the tiers, per version, with `fetched_at` and `is_estimate`.

Both require a signed-in caller, matching the rest of `/api/v1`.

## 7. The page

`/wishes`, its own route — Fribbels puts the Warp Planner in the sidebar's TOOLS group above
the optimizer, not inside a planner, and familiarity is the stated goal (**OQ-W1, resolved
this way**; the cost is two things named "planner", which the nav labels disambiguate as
"Wish Planner" and "Levelling Planner").

Following Fribbels' layout: a three-column settings panel, the **resource line that shows its
arithmetic** (`24,000 💎 + 60 🎫 = 210 🎫`), and a goal table with a proportional bar behind
each chip. Differences: primogems/fates rather than jades/passes, C/R rather than E/S, whole
patches rather than half-patches, and a **Capturing Radiance control** beside Guaranteed.

Recompute is **debounced**, not per-keystroke: `CLAUDE.md` records this repo typing `9999` into
a materials box and writing 9, then 99, then 999. And `Number('') === 0`, so an emptied pity box
must not silently read as pity 0.

## 8. Open questions

| | |
|---|---|
| **OQ-W4** | Multi Target — a queue of banners sharing one budget — in v1? It is most of Fribbels' UI and none of its math. Deferred, not declined. |
| **OQ-W5** | Genshin's wish history is exportable. Derive pity / guarantee / losses rather than asking? Would make the losses counter exact instead of remembered. |
| **OQ-W7** | Does the character banner's two concurrent 5★ split the 50/50 further? gachasim models one promotional character per banner; Genshin runs two. Needs checking before the rate is trusted for a specific character. |
